## Usage

### Basic Event Creation

Important notes:
- Always provide times in UTC
- Use the timezone parameter to specify the display timezone
- Location and URL are handled separately for better calendar integration

```ruby
# Create an event with physical location
event = CalInvite::Event.new(
  title: "Team Meeting",
  start_time: Time.current.utc,  # Always use UTC times
  end_time: Time.current.utc + 2.hours,
  description: "Weekly team sync",
  location: "Conference Room A",  # Physical location
  timezone: "America/New_York",  # Display timezone
  attendees: ["person@example.com"],
  show_attendees: true,
  notes: "Please bring your laptop"
)

# Create an event with both physical and virtual locations
event = CalInvite::Event.new(
  title: "Hybrid Meeting",
  start_time: Time.current.utc,
  end_time: Time.current.utc + 2.hours,
  description: "Weekly team sync",
  location: "Conference Room A",  # Physical location
  url: "https://zoom.us/j/123456789",  # Virtual meeting URL
  timezone: "America/New_York",
  attendees: ["person@example.com"],
  show_attendees: true
)

# All-day event
event = CalInvite::Event.new(
  title: "Company All-Day Event",
  start_time: Date.today.beginning_of_day.utc,
  end_time: Date.today.end_of_day.utc,
  all_day: true,
  timezone: "America/New_York"
)

# Multi-day event
event = CalInvite::Event.new(
  title: "Training Workshop",
  multi_day_sessions: [
    {
      start_time: Time.parse("2024-03-01 08:00:00 UTC"),
      end_time: Time.parse("2024-03-01 17:00:00 UTC")
    },
    {
      start_time: Time.parse("2024-03-02 09:00:00 UTC"),
      end_time: Time.parse("2024-03-02 13:00:00 UTC")
    }
  ],
  description: "Advanced Ruby Training",
  location: "Training Center",
  url: "https://zoom.us/j/123456789",  # Virtual meeting URL kept separate
  timezone: "America/New_York",
  notes: "Bring your own laptop"
)

# Generate calendar URLs
ical_url       = event.generate_calendar_url(:ical)
google_url     = event.generate_calendar_url(:google)
outlook_url    = event.generate_calendar_url(:outlook)
outlook365_url = event.generate_calendar_url(:office365)
yahoo_url      = event.generate_calendar_url(:yahoo)
```

### Implementing ICS Downloads

To enable ICS file downloads in your application, you'll need to:

1. Create an endpoint that will handle the download request
2. Generate the ICS content
3. Send the file to the user

Here's a basic example of the controller logic:

```ruby
# In your controller action
def download_calendar
  event = # ... your event creation logic ...
  
  content = CalInvite::Providers::Ics.new(event).generate
  filename = "#{event.title.downcase.gsub(/[^0-9A-Za-z.\-]/, '_')}_#{Time.now.strftime('%Y%m%d')}.ics"
  
  send_data(
    content,
    filename: filename,
    type: 'text/calendar; charset=UTF-8',
    disposition: 'attachment'
  )
end
```

You can implement this in any controller and route that makes sense for your application's architecture.

### ICS File Generation

The gem provides two ways to generate ICS files:

1. Direct content generation:
```ruby
event = CalInvite::Event.new(
  title: "Meeting",
  start_time: Time.current.utc,
  end_time: Time.current.utc + 1.hour,
  timezone: "America/New_York"
)

# Generate ICS content
content = CalInvite::Providers::Ics.new(event).generate
```

2. Rails controller integration:
```ruby
# In your controller
def download_ics
  event = CalInvite::Event.new(
    title: "Meeting",
    start_time: Time.current.utc,
    end_time: Time.current.utc + 1.hour,
    timezone: "America/New_York"
  )
  
  content = CalInvite::Providers::Ics.new(event).generate
  filename = "#{event.title.downcase.gsub(/[^0-9A-Za-z.\-]/, '_')}_#{Time.now.strftime('%Y%m%d')}.ics"
  
  send_data(
    content,
    filename: filename,
    type: 'text/calendar; charset=UTF-8',
    disposition: 'attachment'
  )
end
```

### Important Notes

1. Time Handling:
   - Always provide times in UTC to the Event constructor
   - Use the timezone parameter to specify the display timezone
   - All-day events should use beginning_of_day.utc and end_of_day.utc

2. Location and URL:
   - Physical location goes in the `location` parameter
   - Virtual meeting URL goes in the `url` parameter
   - They are handled separately for better calendar integration

3. ICS Files:
   - Both Apple iCal and standard ICS files now properly handle timezones
   - Attendees are properly formatted with RSVP options
   - Virtual meeting URLs are properly separated from physical locations

## Caching Support

CalInvite includes built-in caching support to improve performance when generating calendar URLs. To enable caching in your Rails application:

```ruby
# config/initializers/cal_invite.rb
CalInvite.configure do |config|
  # Use Rails cache by default
  config.cache_store = Rails.cache
  
  # Optional: Set cache prefix
  config.cache_prefix = 'my_app_cal_invite'
  
  # Optional: Set expiration time (in seconds)
  config.cache_expires_in = 3600 # 1 hour
end
```

For detailed information about configuring caching in Rails applications and available options, see our [Caching Guide](https://github.com/the-pew-inc/cal-invite/blob/master/CACHING.md)

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Testing

Add test(s) as necessary.

Run all the tests before submitting: `bundle exec rake test`
