#
# ILLUSTRATIVE, NOT PRODUCTION-READY. CalInvite only generates outbound
# invites — when an attendee clicks Accept/Decline in their mail client,
# their calendar app emails an iTIP `METHOD:REPLY` back to the organizer's
# *mailbox*, not to this app. To turn that into a webhook, point an inbound
# email provider (SendGrid Inbound Parse, Postmark Inbound, AWS SES + SNS,
# Mailgun Routes, ...) at the organizer address and have it POST the raw
# MIME message here.
#
# This controller shows the shape of that handler using a plain regex
# extraction of the `text/calendar` part. For production, parse with a real
# iCalendar parser (e.g. the `icalendar` gem) instead of regexes — mail
# clients vary in how they fold/escape lines, and a regex will eventually
# choke on something a real parser wouldn't.
#
# See CONFIGURATION.md's "Tracking RSVPs" for the full picture, including
# why raw .ics email invites often can't be tracked this way at all unless
# the organizer address is backed by a real mailbox/calendar system.
