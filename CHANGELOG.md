# Cal Invite

## [v0.2.0] - 2026-08-09

- Add `Event#organizer` and a `method:` option (`:publish`/`:request`/`:cancel`) to `generate_calendar_url`, so ics/ical output can carry `METHOD:REQUEST`/`METHOD:CANCEL` + `ORGANIZER`/`SEQUENCE`/`STATUS`, matching what mail clients (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail) need to render an attached `.ics` as an RSVP-capable meeting invite (or a real cancellation) rather than a plain file
- `ATTENDEE` lines now include `CUTYPE`/`ROLE`/`PARTSTAT`
- `IcsDownload.headers`/`.wrap_for_download` accept `method:` to add the matching `method=REQUEST` Content-Type parameter
- Fix a `superclass mismatch` crash when both the `:ics` provider and `IcsDownload`/`IcsContent` were loaded (dead duplicate `Ics`/`Ical` class definitions in `ics_content.rb`)
- **Fix: stable `UID`.** `Event#uid` is now a real attribute (auto-generated and memoized per `Event` instance, or pass your own) instead of the ics/ical/ics_content providers each minting a fresh random UID on every `generate` call — required for mail/calendar clients to recognize a `:request` update or `:cancel` as referring to a previously sent invite rather than a new, unrelated event. See new `Event#sequence` (defaults to `0`) and CONFIGURATION.md's "Updating and cancelling invites".
- **Fix: real `VTIMEZONE`.** `:ics`/`:ical` now emit a complete `VTIMEZONE` component (`STANDARD`/`DAYLIGHT` observances with correct offsets and `RRULE`s, derived from TZInfo's transition data) for any recognized IANA timezone, instead of an empty/absent block. `DTSTART;TZID=...`/`DTEND;TZID=...` are also now correctly converted from UTC to that zone's local wall-clock time — previously the UTC clock digits were emitted verbatim under a non-UTC `TZID`, mislabeling the time. `'UTC'` continues to use plain `Z`-suffixed timestamps with no `VTIMEZONE`, as before.
- Add `tzinfo` as an explicit gem dependency (previously relied on it only transitively via `activesupport`).
- `Event#attendees` entries can now be `{ email:, name:, partstat: }` hashes (plain email strings still work) — `ATTENDEE` lines gain `CN=` and a settable `PARTSTAT` (`:accepted`/`:declined`/`:tentative`/`:needs_action`/`:delegated`) instead of always `NEEDS-ACTION`.
- Add `method: :reply`, for building an attendee's `METHOD:REPLY` back to an organizer (omits `RSVP=TRUE`, honors each attendee's `partstat:`).
- Add `Event#geo` (`GEO:` property), `Event#reminders` (`VALARM` blocks), `Event#busy` (`TRANSP:`), `Event#visibility` (`CLASS:`), `Event#rrule` (raw `RRULE:` recurrence value), and `Event#calendar_name` (`X-WR-CALNAME` on the `VCALENDAR`) — all optional, all emitted by `:ics`/`:ical`/`IcsContent`.
- Add `method: :counter`/`:decline_counter`, generating `METHOD:COUNTER`/`METHOD:DECLINECOUNTER` for an attendee proposing a new time and an organizer rejecting it, respectively. (Note: `:decline_counter` correctly renders as `METHOD:DECLINECOUNTER` — one word per RFC 5545 — not a literal upcase of the Ruby symbol; fixed via a new `BaseProvider#method_value` used everywhere a `METHOD:`/`method=` value is emitted, including `IcsDownload.headers`.)
- Add `Event#importance` (`:low`/`:normal`/`:high` → standard `PRIORITY:` + Outlook's `X-MICROSOFT-CDO-IMPORTANCE:`) and `Event#allow_counter` (default `true`; `false` → Outlook's `X-MICROSOFT-DISALLOW-COUNTER:TRUE`, hiding its "Propose New Time" action) and `X-MICROSOFT-CDO-BUSYSTATUS` alongside the existing `TRANSP:` — genuinely real, protocol-level, Outlook-specific properties (confirmed against Microsoft's documented `.ics` extensions), safe to always emit since RFC 5545 requires unrecognized `X-` properties be ignored by other clients.
- CONFIGURATION.md: rewrite "Guest permissions" — Google/Microsoft's guest-permission toggles are confirmed API-only (no `.ics` property, no parameter on Google's own "add to calendar" render URL either), but the section now documents the real Outlook-specific levers above as the closest addable equivalent. Rewrite "Attendee-proposed reschedules (COUNTER)" now that generation is implemented, with the caveat that mainstream mail clients still don't reliably expose a "propose new time" UI to trigger one from. Add "Tracking RSVPs" (inbound `METHOD:REPLY` webhook vs. provider-API alternative, with the Gmail reliability caveat) for the RSVP-tracking gap, which remains genuinely outbound-only.
- `Example/calendar_app`: add a working `Meeting`/`MeetingAttendee` persistence example (migration + models + `MeetingsController#create`/`#reschedule`/`#cancel` + `MeetingMailer`) demonstrating the `uid`/`sequence` lifecycle end-to-end, plus an illustrative `EventRepliesController` showing how to parse an inbound `METHOD:REPLY` email. The example app's Gemfile still tracks the published gem — this demo needs 0.2.0, so run it locally against `path: "../.."` until that's released.
- Add per-attendee `rsvp:` override (`{ email:, name:, partstat:, rsvp: }`) so `RSVP=TRUE` can be suppressed even under `method: :request` — needed for a "registration confirmed" style invite where the recipient is already `partstat: :accepted` and nothing is actually being requested. **Fixed a real bug found while adding it**: the existing symbol/string dual-key lookup pattern (`attendee[:key] || attendee["key"]`) silently discards an explicit `false` value (`false || x` evaluates to `x` in Ruby, not `false`), which would have made `rsvp: false` a no-op; replaced with `BaseProvider#attendee_hash_value`, used for all attendee-hash reads.
- CONFIGURATION.md: add "Replicating a ticketing-platform confirmation email" — a full worked example (matching a real Luma-style confirmation email byte-for-byte in structure, brand names genericized) covering the `partstat: :accepted, rsvp: false` attendee pattern, the full ActionMailer attachment setup, why `From`/`Reply-To`/`ORGANIZER` can legitimately all differ, and an explicit note that Apple Wallet `.pkpass` passes are an unrelated technology (PassKit, not iCalendar) and out of scope for this gem.
